                    <p>Hi. This is my website. I hope you like it.</p>

                    <p>My plans for the site include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A makeshift wiki of my original characters, as well as my worldbuilding projects</li>
                        <li>A place to post my art, writing, and other creative endeavors</li>
                        <li>A place to explore my hobbies, including (but not limited to) video games and music</li>
                        <li>A <a href="https://blog.wormingnightfall.github.io">blog</a> to further discuss the aforementioned</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Currently, the site is a major work in progress. I'm working on it most days, but there's a lot of work to be done before the site is even close to figured out.</p>
                    <p>If you happen to be reading this, I hope you're having a good time.</p>

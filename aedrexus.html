                <h1>Aedrexus</h1>
                    <p>The Realm of Aedrexus is a worldbuilding project between my husband and I. Currently it is a largely modified version of Forgotten Realms, but we're slowly building onto it, with an ideal plan of everything being original or heavily modified eventually.</p>
                    <p>The setting can be described as dark medieval high fantasy with cosmic horror and general horror elements.</p>
